Arch Linux Command Scripts

I started using https://garudalinux.org/[Garuda] Linux, a distribution based on https://archlinux.org/[Arch] linux.

Coming from Mac and https://linuxmint.com/[Mint] linux, I had lost some of my favourite commands.

This repository is an attempt to make my life easier.

I am sharing in-case it helps you too.


== Java

Applicable to any linux distribution. These scripts are as simple as possible

.Java Command Example
[source, bash]
----
java11.sh -jar /path/to/jar.jar
----

In essence, it checks to see which java is installed.

The following is an exert from `java11.sh`

.Checking For Java
[source, bash]
----
## Check for open JDK
if [ -d "/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk/bin" ]; then
# Set the java env variables
export PATH="/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk/bin/:$PATH"
export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk"
----

NOTE: There may be better ways to do it, it works for me.

== Gradle

Gradle chains the `java.sh` command with the gradle command.

.Example: Running `gradle11.sh` (Java 11 + Gradle)
[source,shell]
----
gradle11.sh clean springBootRun
----

== Maven

Maven chains the `java.sh` command with the maven command.

.Example: Running `mvn11.sh` (Java 11 + Maven)
[source,bash]
----
mvn11.sh clean compile
----
